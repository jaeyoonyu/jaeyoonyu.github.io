title: "Python Code - Basics"
---

I share some **python code** snippets that are useful, especially for those who would like to study **Python for Data Analytics and Accounting Research**. This page is not designed to walk you through Python basics. Rather, I organize and share code snippets that I use often (and I forget). The snippets are mainly relevant to the following topics: 
* Data wrangling with Numpy and Pandas
* Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
* Regular expression with Regex
* Textual analysis
* Web-scraping with Requests, Beautifulsoup, and Selenium
