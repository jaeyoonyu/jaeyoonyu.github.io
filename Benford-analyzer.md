The **Benford Analyzer** is designed for practical use in my accounting courses. Students enrolled in **Data Analytics for Accounting (ACC575)** will have the opportunity to create and use it during class exercises. This tool helps students explore **Benfordâ€™s Law**, a fascinating statistical principle that can be used to detect anomalies in financial data.

Whether you are curious about financial data patterns or preparing for professional accounting work, this tool provides a **practical introduction to data-driven decision making**.

For more information on Benford's Law, you can refer to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law).
