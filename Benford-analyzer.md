The <b>Benford Analyzer</b> is designed for practical use in my accounting courses. Students enrolled in <b>Data Analytics for Accounting (ACC575)</b> will have the opportunity to create and use it during class exercises. This tool helps students explore <b>Benfordâ€™s Law</b>, a fascinating statistical principle that can be used to detect anomalies in financial data.

Whether you are curious about financial data patterns or preparing for professional accounting work, this tool provides a <b>practical introduction to data-driven decision making</b>. Throw in a series of numbers (for example, the revenues of 100 companies) and see what happens in the tool below!
