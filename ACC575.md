title: "Data Analytics for Accounting"
---

Welcome to my Data Analytics for Accounting course (ACC575). This page includes course materials and interactive applications designed to help accounting students understand data analytics concepts and tools—from Python basics to practical applications in accounting research and Benford's Law analysis—through engaging, hands-on learning experiences.


## Core Principles for Accounting Analytics

Beyond technical proficiency, successful analysts must develop a disciplined approach to data integrity. In this course, we emphasize:

* **Establishing Proper Expectations:** It is critical to establish a "skepticism-first" mindset in advance. Students must understand that structured data is not a finished product; assuming data is perfect leads to flawed conclusions.
* **Capabilities to Plan and Inspect:** Students must develop the capability to proactively plan for data anomalies and the technical skill to inspect issues by tracing "structured" results back to their original human-readable sources.

* **An Example Case Study**: When "Machine-Readable" Isn't "Truth". A prime example of why these principles matter is found in the article: [When Structured Data Isn’t What the Company Reported](https://directedgar.blog/2026/01/28/when-structured-data-isnt-what-the-company-reported/). This case highlights a systematic software bug in Inline XBRL filings that inflated reported public float values by a factor of one million. While the data was technically "valid" to a computer, it was economically impossible. This reinforces the lesson that automation does not replace the need for professional judgment and source verification.
