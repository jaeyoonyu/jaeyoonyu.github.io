Welcome to my collection of interactive auditing teaching materials. These dynamic HTML applications are designed to help accounting students understand key auditing concepts—from the U.S. regulatory framework (SEC, PCAOB, AICPA) to audit procedures and internal controls—through engaging, clickable visualizations that make complex relationships clearer and more memorable.
**Disclaimer**: The materials are still under development and may contain errors or incomplete information. Please use them as supplementary learning tools and always refer to official standards and textbooks for authoritative guidance. E-mail me if you spot any **"material" errors**!
