I'm an assistant professor in Accounting at the Erasmus School of Economics (ESE), Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), the Netherlands. My research interests include auditing, capital market, corporate finance (IPOs and SEOs), corporate governance, and financial reporting. My research has been published in excellent journals such as <em>Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory</em> and <em>European Accounting Review</em>. I've thought various courses including introduction to accounting, advanced financial accounting, auditing seminar, and introduction to SAS for accounting doctoral students. I also supervise master students at ESE for their research thesis.
